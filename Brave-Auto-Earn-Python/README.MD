#   Brave Auto Earn Python Alternative

This python script is an alternative you can use to the other two, but in some ways this one.

## How to use

-Make sure to have at least python v3.7 installed

-Use either 'xdotool getmouselocation' or '[System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position' to replace the values in main.py

-Make sure to paste the complete directory to the brave browser executable in location.txt, deleting the sample code in place.

-To install the requirements.txt, simply run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in a terminal.

-Lastly, run main.py and you are good to go!

## Other information

-The current coordinates are setup for people with an Asus VivoBook

-Use a high number for the number of cycles - 10000000 will keep it running for a while!

-You can stop the script at any time by closing brave and/or Ctrl+C.

-Don't click anywhere on brave when the script is running, otherwise it breaks it.

-It uses the pyautogui module - this script is best used when you do not need your pc for other tasks.

-Feel free to tip me 😀

## Why use this instead?

-It has fewer coordinates for you to change/find (more efficient and easier to setup)

-Runs on multiple operating systems (only python 🐍 required) 

-Does not bookmark advert pages

-It has cool orange 🍊 text in the terminal :)
